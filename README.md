    ```

2. Cipher Vault will display a menu with the following options:

    ```
    For text encryption/decryption choose 1
    To exit choose 2
    ```

3. Select option `1` to choose a cipher from a list of classic ciphers.

4. Choose your desired cipher and follow the on-screen instructions to:

    - Select an operation (encryption or decryption).
    - Provide the text to be processed.
    - Enter the required key or information.

5. Cipher Vault will perform the operation and display the result.

6. Repeat steps 3-5 to explore different ciphers and operations.

7. To exit Cipher Vault, select option `2`.
